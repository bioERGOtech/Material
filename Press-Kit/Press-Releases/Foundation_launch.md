## bioERGOtech ETS Launches New Research Center for Advanced Cell Therapies

**TARANTO, Italy - April 27, 2025** - The bioERGOtech Foundation (Fondazione bioERGOtech ETS) is proud to announce the establishment of a new research center dedicated to the development of innovative cellular therapies and personalized medicine approaches.

### Bridging Science and Application

Founded by biomedical engineer Guido Patrignano alongside prominent professionals including attorney Domenica Leone and other founding members, bioERGOtech aims to create a hub of excellence where cutting-edge research in cellular therapies can be translated into concrete applications that benefit patients.

"Our ultimate goal is to develop accessible and personalized cell therapies capable of responding to previously untreatable chronic diseases, focusing on scientific excellence with a real impact on people's health," stated Patrignano, President of the Foundation.

### A Comprehensive Approach to Innovation

The Foundation will focus on several key areas:

- **Advanced Cell Therapies**: Developing engineering approaches for treating chronic diseases
- **Integrated Omics Studies**: Conducting research in genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics to understand the molecular basis of diseases
- **Personalized Medicine and Bioinformatics**: Creating advanced bioinformatic platforms for biological big data analysis
- **Clinical Trials and Therapeutic Validation**: Coordinating clinical studies for new therapies from preclinical phases through human trials

The research center will feature state-of-the-art laboratories for basic research alongside clinical facilities to enable the translation of scientific discoveries into therapeutic applications.

### Collaboration at the Core

A distinctive feature of bioERGOtech is its "Flexible Specialization" approach, emphasizing collaboration rather than competition. The Foundation has established both a Scientific Committee and a Technical Committee to ensure rigorous scientific oversight alongside practical implementation expertise.

"We don't want to automate research, but make it more intelligent," explained Patrignano. "Our open laboratories will analyze individualized treatment protocols that can go beyond traditional approaches."

The Foundation has already begun developing international scientific collaborations, with particular attention to research institutes across Europe and partnerships with industry leaders in the biotechnology sector.

### Supporting Innovation Ecosystem

Beyond its research activities, bioERGOtech will also:

- Create an incubator for biotech startups
- Organize advanced training programs and educational initiatives
- Manage patent activities and intellectual property valorization
- Establish research consortia and partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotech companies

### Path Forward

The infrastructure development for the research center is expected to be completed by spring 2026, with a particular focus on integrating information technology infrastructure with scientific protocols.
